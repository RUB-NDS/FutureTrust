FutureTrust aims at supporting the practical implementation of electronic identification (eID) services in Europe and beyond. It addresses the need for globally interoperable solutions through basic research with respect to the foundations of trust and trustworthiness, supports the standardisation process in relevant areas, and provides Open Source software components which will ease the use of eID in real world applications. More information can be found on our official webiste: https://www.futuretrust.eu.

The present website provides an overview of our contributions regarding the security of eID services and **invites further stakeholders to contribute to this research.** 

The project is funded within the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2020) under Grant Agreement No. 700542.


# Overview of eID Services

Our first contribution is the documentation of existing governmental and commercial eID services. It investigates the usage of authentication schemes and protocols and their security properties. In particular, it concentrates on three major protocols: SAML, OpenID, and OpenID Connect. It shows how these protocols are used in different countries, which authentication methods are used, and how the issued authentication tokens are transported over secure channels.

Information about the existing eID services were collected from whitepapers and scientific publications as well as with custom tools. Countries from the European Union, European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein), and other countries applying eID protocols were considered in our analysis.
