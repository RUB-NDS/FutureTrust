This documentation gives an overview of existing governmental and commercial eID services. It investigates the usage of authentication schemes and protocols and their security properties. In particular, it concentrates on three major protocols: SAML, OpenID, and OpenID Connect. It shows how these protocols are used in different countries, which authentication methods are used, and how the issued authentication tokens are transported over secure channels.

Information about the existing eID services were collected from whitepapers and scientific publications as well as with custom tools. Countries from the European Union, European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein), and other countries applying eID protocols were considered in our analysis.
